# Advanced Async Patterns in JavaScript

This project demonstrates advanced async/await patterns using native JavaScript Promises. Ideal for showcasing modern JavaScript concurrency on GitHub.

## 🧩 Features

- ✅ Sequential async logic
- ⚡ Parallel execution with `Promise.all`
- 🛑 Error handling with `try/catch`
- 💪 Resilient multi-promise handling with `Promise.allSettled`

## 🗂 File Overview

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `runTasksSequentially.js` | Runs async tasks one after another (awaits each before proceeding) |
| `runTasksInParallel.js` | Executes async tasks in parallel using `Promise.all` |
| `handleAsynErrors.js` | Demonstrates error handling in async functions |
| `usePromiseAllSettled.js` | Runs tasks and handles both resolved and rejected cases without breaking |
